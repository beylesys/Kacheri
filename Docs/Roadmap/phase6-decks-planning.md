# Phase 6: Decks (Presentation Tool) — Planning Document

**Created:** 2025-01-05
**Status:** PLANNING (Pre-Scope Definition)
**Next Action:** Define MVP scope and differentiators

---

## Context

Phase 5 (Replay Analytics & Verification Dashboard) is 95% complete. The decision was made to pursue Phase 6 (breadth expansion) rather than Prod-Ready hardening (Section 2.x), reasoning that showcasing the full "AI-Native Office Suite" vision (Docs + Decks + Sheets) provides stronger differentiation in pilots than a polished single-artifact tool.

**Focus:** Decks first, then Sheets later.

---

## Current State

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Decks codebase | **0%** — No code exists |
| Sheets codebase | **0%** — No code exists |
| Blueprint mention | "Phase 6: Slides & Sheets scaffolding — 10%" (aspirational, not actual) |
| Specification document | **None** — This document begins that process |

---

## Strategic Challenge

### The Enterprise vs Consumer Gap

The verification/proof pipeline is a strong **enterprise differentiator** (compliance, audit trails, tamper detection). However, it doesn't immediately resonate with **regular users** who just want to make presentations.

**We need a consumer-grade differentiator** — something that makes regular users *want* to use Kacheri Decks over Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Canva.

---

## Differentiator Ideas (To Be Prioritized)

### 1. AI Story Coach (Narrative Intelligence)

**Concept:** AI analyzes deck flow and provides structural feedback.

**Features:**
- Flags disconnected slides: "Slide 5 doesn't connect to Slide 6"
- Suggests narrative improvements: "Your conclusion doesn't reference your opening hook"
- "Presentation Score" showing coherence, clarity, pacing
- Before/after comparison when improvements are applied

**Why it's different:** Other tools generate content. This coaches structure and narrative.

**Proof integration:** Story analysis results stored as proof packets; improvements tracked.

---

### 2. Rehearsal Mode with AI Feedback

**Concept:** Practice presenting with intelligent feedback.

**Features:**
- Webcam/mic-based rehearsal recording
- AI feedback on:
  - Time spent per slide (flags imbalance)
  - Filler words ("um", "like")
  - Pacing and pauses
  - Confidence signals (optional advanced)
- Rehearsal history with improvement tracking

**Why it's different:** PowerPoint has rehearsal timing. This has intelligent, actionable feedback.

**Proof integration:** Rehearsal sessions logged; improvement over time trackable.

---

### 3. Smart Repurpose (One Content, Many Formats)

**Concept:** Create once, derive many outputs.

**Features:**
- From a deck, AI generates:
  - Executive summary (1-page document)
  - Detailed leave-behind document
  - Speaker notes (if not present)
  - Social media snippets
  - Email summary
- All derivations linked to source with proof trails

**Why it's different:** Others help you make slides. This helps you leverage slides across contexts.

**Proof integration:** Derivation chain fully traceable; source deck → derived artifacts.

---

### 4. Audience Adaptation

**Concept:** One deck, multiple audiences.

**Features:**
- "Adapt for Technical Audience" / "Adapt for Executive Audience" / "Adapt for Sales"
- AI rewrites content:
  - Adjusts depth and detail level
  - Changes terminology
  - Reorders emphasis
- Side-by-side diff showing all changes
- Maintain multiple variants linked to source

**Why it's different:** You don't maintain multiple versions manually; AI handles adaptation with full transparency.

**Proof integration:** Each adaptation is a proofed AI action; variants linked to source.

---

### 5. Confidence Mode (Pre-Presentation Checklist)

**Concept:** AI-powered peace of mind before presenting.

**Features:**
- Automated checklist:
  - "All slides have speaker notes" ✓/✗
  - "No placeholder text found" ✓/✗
  - "No empty slides" ✓/✗
  - "Narrative flows logically" ✓/✗
  - "Consistent formatting" ✓/✗
- Timing estimate based on content density
- "Ready to present" confidence score
- Quick-fix suggestions for any issues found

**Why it's different:** Removes presenter anxiety; catches mistakes before the big meeting.

**Proof integration:** Checklist results logged; fixes tracked.

---

### 6. Collaborative AI with Attribution

**Concept:** Transparency in team AI usage.

**Features:**
- When team members use AI, it's visible:
  - "Sarah added this slide using AI compose"
  - "AI suggested this bullet point, approved by Mike"
  - "This image was AI-generated by Alex"
- Per-slide AI contribution percentage
- Filter view: "Show only human-written content" / "Show only AI-assisted content"

**Why it's different:** Full transparency in collaborative AI usage; no hidden AI contributions.

**Proof integration:** Native to the proof architecture; this is surfacing what's already tracked.

## Open Questions (To Resolve Before Scoping)

### 1. Differentiator Priority

**Question:** Which 1-2 differentiators should be in MVP?

**Options to rank:**
- [ ] AI Story Coach
- [ ] Rehearsal Mode
- [ ] Smart Repurpose
- [ ] Audience Adaptation
- [ ] Confidence Mode
- [ ] Collaborative AI Attribution

**Recommendation:** Start with **Confidence Mode** (lower complexity, high perceived value) + **AI Story Coach** (unique, showcases AI-native architecture).

---

### 2. Target User Persona

**Question:** Who is the primary user for Decks MVP?

**Options:**
- [ ] Startup founder pitching investors
- [ ] Sales rep doing customer presentations
- [ ] Teacher/trainer creating educational content
- [ ] Marketing creating campaign decks
- [ ] Knowledge worker (general internal presentations)

**Impact:** Persona determines default templates, AI tone, and feature emphasis.

---

### 3. MVP Scope Level

**Question:** How feature-complete should MVP be?

| Level | Editor Features | Differentiators | Estimate |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Lean** | Basic slides (text, images, shapes) | 1 killer feature | 3-4 weeks |
| **Moderate** | Full editor (transitions, layouts, themes) | 2-3 features | 6-8 weeks |
| **Full** | Near-parity with Slides | All differentiators | 12+ weeks |

**Recommendation:** Start **Lean**, prove the differentiator, then expand.

---

### 4. Export Priority

**Question:** Which export formats for MVP?

| Format | Complexity | Value |
|--------|------------|-------|
| PDF | Low | Universal viewing |
| PPTX | Medium | Interoperability with PowerPoint |
| Present Mode | Medium | Native presentation experience |
| HTML | Low | Web sharing |

**Recommendation:** PDF first (quick win), then Present Mode (native experience), then PPTX (interop).

---

### 5. Architecture Decisions

**Question:** How does Decks integrate with existing infrastructure?

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Editor framework | Tiptap (extend) vs. dedicated (Slatejs, custom) | Evaluate; Tiptap may not suit slide paradigm |
| Data model | Extend `docs` table vs. new `decks` table | New `decks` table (different structure) |
| Proof pipeline | Shared with Docs vs. Decks-specific | Shared infrastructure, Decks-specific proof types |
| Real-time collab | Same Yjs infrastructure | Yes, reuse |
| File manager | Same `fs_nodes` with new type | Yes, add `deck` node type |

---

## Competitive Landscape (Reference)

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Google Slides** | Real-time collab, simplicity, free | Limited AI, basic templates |
| **PowerPoint** | Rich features, animations, enterprise | Desktop-centric, AI bolted-on |
| **Canva** | Beautiful defaults, design-first | Not presentation-focused, limited collab |
| **Pitch** | Modern UI, team workflows | Smaller ecosystem, limited integrations |
| **Gamma** | AI-first generation | Less control, not collaborative |
| **Beautiful.ai** | Auto-design | Limited customization |

**Kacheri Decks positioning:** AI-native with proof trails + unique differentiator (Story Coach / Confidence Mode).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve open questions** (differentiators, persona, scope level, exports)
2. **Create `phase6-decks-work-scope.md`** with detailed implementation plan
3. **Design database schema** for decks
4. **Prototype editor approach** (Tiptap extension vs. dedicated)
5. **Begin implementation** per prioritized scope

---

## Session Note

**2025-01-05:** Initial planning discussion. Decision to focus on Decks before Sheets. Identified need for consumer-grade differentiator beyond enterprise verification pipeline. Listed 6 potential differentiators. Questions documented for next session.

*This document will evolve into a formal work scope once open questions are resolved.*
